I am an accomplished and performance-driven professional with extensive experience in international business, software development, and scientific research in the IT and healthcare sectors. I hold two PhDs: one in üß¨ Health Sciences and another in üß¨ Computer Science. I deliver secure, stable, innovative technology solutions as CTO and CBDO (at ITware, Hungary). I bring creative problem-solving to B2B and B2C projects by removing complexity and identifying clear implementation paths for efficient business operations.

Motivation
======
My motivation is to ensure business development as a continuous improvement project. I am committed to building strong, efficient, professional development teams through technically challenging projects.
